 * Sends {@link #FILE_PING_REQUEST_OK} synchronously with product {@link #PRODUCT_TEST_3} from {@link #ACTOR_AXEL} to {@link #ACTOR_REFERENCE}.
 * The request should pass public agreement validation and be routed to the destination where an exception is raised, that states that 'Matilda' cannot invoke a SOAP service call.
